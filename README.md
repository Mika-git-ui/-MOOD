# [‡¥§‡µá‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡µá‡¥ü‡µÜ MOOD] üéØ


## Introducing..............   "‡¥§‡µá‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡µá‡¥ü‡µÜ MOOD"
Yepppp U heard it rightt,bro we are talking about mood of a coconut(Whatttt??)
So whats the deal?Welll most of the malayalis eppolenkilum once in their life must have risked their life parking under a coconut tree
All we have to do is take a pic of the ‡¥§‡µÜ‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡µç(with thegha)and.....
Our app detects whether a coconut is in a falling mood or not using:
"wind + color + vibes" (aka Kerala Feng Shui)
*colour
*wind
*Pure malayali logic like "‡¥§‡µÜ‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ô‡µç ‡¥ö‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µç‡¥≤" (Le Thenga: BRO WHO SAID??)and a lot....moreee
And give u the RIGHT(please listen to ur gut feeeling too) replies:
üü¢ Safe to Park ‚Äì Thenga not ready yet
No tension, mone! U can‚Ä¶ chill your Dzire. üòé
And Our app is as reliable as KSEB's power-cut promises(NO offense)
